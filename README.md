Prerequisites Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements: XAMPP, PHP, MySQL, web server and visual coder.

Installation Clone the repository: bash Copy code: git clone https://github.com/siddhantsatote/getfilevault.git

How to Download and Setup from Drive:

Step 1: Download Files from Google Drive: Go to your Google Drive and locate the "SecureFileShare" project folder. Right-click the folder and select "Download". This will download a ZIP file containing the project files.

Step 2: Extract ZIP File: After downloading, extract the ZIP file to a location on your local computer. The extracted folder should contain the project's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and other files.

Step 3: Upload Files to Server: Use an FTP client (e.g., FileZilla) or your hosting provider's file manager to upload the extracted project folder to your web server's public directory (often called public_html or www).

Step 4: Create MySQL Database: Log in to your hosting control panel. Create a new MySQL database and note down the database name, username, password, and hostname.

Step 5: Import Database Tables: In your hosting control panel, look for a tool like phpMyAdmin. Use phpMyAdmin to import the database file that came with the project (if provided). This will create the necessary tables.

Step 6: Configure Database Connection: Inside the project folder, locate the database.php file. Open database.php in a text editor and update the database connection parameters (hostname, username, password, database name) with the values from your MySQL database.

Step 7: Set Up Virtual Host (Optional): If you want to access the project using a custom domain, set up a virtual host in your server configuration pointing to the project folder.

Step 8: Access the Project: Open a web browser and enter the URL of your project (e.g., http://yourdomain.com). You should be directed to the login page. You can create a user using the registration form if it's provided in the project.

Customization You can customize the design of the project by editing the CSS files located in the css/ directory. Feel free to modify colors, fonts, and styles to match your preferences.
